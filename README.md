# Development of Machine Learning and Chemical Language Model-Based QSAR Models for Predicting Drug Residue Depletion Half-Lives in Plasma and Tissues of Cattle Across Various Administration Routes

## üìå Overview

This repository provides two distinct yet complementary pipelines for predicting the depletion half-lives (`LambdaZHl`) of veterinary drugs in cattle, encompassing both traditional machine learning (ML-QSAR) and advanced transformer-based approaches (ImprovedChemBERTa). Each section includes support for model interpretability, applicability domain analysis, and performance evaluation, facilitating robust and explainable predictions for food safety risk assessment.
